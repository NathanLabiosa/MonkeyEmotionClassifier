# MonkeyEmotionClassifier

This was a personal project of Nathan Labiosa.

The goal was to create a neural network classifier to identify primate emotions.
The practical application could be used by zoos or wildlife santuaraies to better understand primate emotions while undergoing observation. These different emotions could influence group actions and decidiosn, so they would be crutial to recognize.
